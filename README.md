1. Deposit collateral: ETH / WETH
weth is needed 
weth is wETH is the ERC-20 compatible and tradable version of ETH and
 can be used to interact with other ERC-20 assets.
2. Borrow another asset : Dai
3. Repay dai
 dai is a stable coin that has the price of one dollar

 so here is the process
 first we need to allow user to deposit in dai which needs the lendingpool 
 contract and the iweth contract

 secondly
 we need to borrow asset in dai
 that means we need to get a contract to convert to dai..
 when converted prints out how much one can borrow

 thirdly
 repaying
